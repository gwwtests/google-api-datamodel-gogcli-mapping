notes: |
  CRITICAL for recurring events understanding:
  - recurrence field contains RRULE strings (RFC 5545 format)
  - Recurring event has recurrence field set
  - Instances have recurringEventId pointing to parent
  - Instances have originalStartTime for exception handling
  - Use events.instances to expand recurring event to instances
  - Modified instances are separate event resources
