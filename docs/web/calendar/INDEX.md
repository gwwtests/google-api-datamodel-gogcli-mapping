## Key Findings Summary

### Identifiers

**Calendar ID** (`id` field):

* Type: string
* Format: Email address (e.g., `user@example.com`, `calendarid@group.calendar.google.com`)
* Uniqueness: Global
* Primary calendar ID: User's primary email address (immutable while account exists)
* Other calendar IDs: Email-like identifiers, globally unique

**Event ID** (`id` field):

* Type: string
* Format: Base32hex encoding (lowercase a-v, digits 0-9)
* Length: 5-1024 characters
* Uniqueness: **Per calendar** (NOT globally unique)
* **CRITICAL**: Use composite key `(calendarId, eventId)` for global uniqueness
* Can specify custom ID at creation (or auto-generated by server)
* Immutable

**iCalUID** (`iCalUID` field):

* Type: string
* Purpose: iCalendar standard identifier (RFC 5545)
* Uniqueness: Shared across all instances of a recurring event
* Different from event ID: All recurring instances have different `id`s but same `iCalUID`

**Recurring Event Instance IDs**:

* Each instance has different event ID (often `<recurring-event-id>_<timestamp>`)
* `recurringEventId` field points to parent recurring event
* `originalStartTime` identifies which instance (even if moved)

### Calendars vs CalendarList

**Calendars Collection**:

* Global calendar metadata (title, description, timezone)
* Shared across all users with access
* Operations: create/delete calendars, modify global properties

**CalendarList Collection**:

* User-specific calendar view (what appears in user's calendar list)
* User-specific properties: color, notifications, reminders, visibility
* Same calendar has different CalendarList entries for each user
* Operations: add/remove calendars from user's list, modify user-specific properties

### Timezones

**Timed Events**:

* Use `start.dateTime` and `end.dateTime` fields (RFC3339 format)
* Timezone specified via:
  * Inline offset in dateTime (e.g., `2011-06-03T10:00:00.000-07:00`)
  * OR explicit `start.timeZone` field (IANA format, e.g., `"America/Los_Angeles"`)
* For recurring events: `start.timeZone` is **required** (specifies recurrence expansion timezone)
* For single events: `start.timeZone` is optional (indicates custom timezone)

**All-Day Events**:

* Use `start.date` and `end.date` fields (format: `yyyy-mm-dd`)
* **timeZone field has NO significance** for all-day events
* Span midnight-to-midnight in calendar's timezone

**Calendar Default Timezone**:

* Calendar resource has `timeZone` field (IANA format)
* Used for display and when event doesn't specify explicit timezone

### Recurring Events

**RRULE Format** (RFC 5545):

* Stored in `recurrence` field as array of strings
* Components: `FREQ` (required), `INTERVAL`, `UNTIL`, `COUNT`, etc.
* Example: `"RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;UNTIL=20110701T170000Z"`

**Recurring Event vs Instances**:

* Recurring event: Has `recurrence` field set, single event ID
* Instances: Created by expanding recurrence, each has different event ID
* Use `events.instances` method to expand recurring event to instances

**Modified Instances**:

* Modified instances are separate event resources
* Have `recurringEventId` pointing to parent
* Have `originalStartTime` for identification

### Sharing and ACL

**Access Roles** (increasing privilege):

* `none`: No access
* `freeBusyReader`: See busy/free only (no event details)
* `reader`: Read events
* `writer`: Read/write events + see ACLs
* `owner`: All writer permissions + modify ACLs

**Event Visibility** (for shared calendars):

* `default`: Determined by calendar ACL (can differ per attendee)
* `public`: Visible to anyone with freeBusyReader+ access
* `private`: Only visible to writer+ access

**Grantee Types**:

* Individual user
* User group
* Domain
* Public (everyone)

**Sharing Behavior**:

* Sharing calendar doesn't auto-insert to CalendarList
* Must explicitly call `calendarList.insert` for user to see it
* Primary calendar: user always has owner role, cannot be removed
* Maximum 6,000 ACLs per calendar

### Organizer vs Creator

**Creator** (`creator` field):

* User who created the event
* Read-only
* For shared events: may differ from organizer

**Organizer** (`organizer` field):

* Calendar containing the "main copy" of the event
* For single-user events: usually same as creator
* For shared events: the calendar that "owns" the event
* Can be changed via `events.move` operation

### Attendees

**Attendee Properties**:

* `email`: Attendee email (required when adding)
* `id`: Profile ID (if available)
* `responseStatus`: needsAction, declined, tentative, accepted
* `organizer`: Boolean indicating if attendee is the organizer
* `self`: Boolean indicating if this is the current user's calendar

**Event Copies**:

* When user is invited: copy created on their primary calendar
* Copy visible according to attendee's sharing configuration
* Attendee can modify their copy (color, reminders) independently

## Data Model Questions Answered

### Q: If I have an event ID, is it unique globally?

**A**: No. Event IDs are unique **per calendar** only. Use `(calendarId, eventId)` composite key for global uniqueness.

### Q: If two people share a calendar event, do they see the same event ID?

**A**: Yes. It's the same event on the same calendar, so same event ID.

### Q: What timezone is the event time in?

**A**:

* **Timed events**: Specified in `start.timeZone` or via offset in `start.dateTime` (RFC3339)
* **All-day events**: Date only (`start.date`), timezone has no significance
* **Default**: Calendar's default timezone if not explicitly specified

### Q: How do I get all instances of a recurring event?

**A**: Use `events.instances` method with the recurring event ID. Each instance is a separate event resource with its own ID.

### Q: Are calendar IDs unique across accounts?

**A**: Yes. Calendar IDs are email addresses, globally unique. Primary calendar ID = user's email.

## Empirical Testing Needed

1. Event ID uniqueness: Confirm event IDs are truly unique only per-calendar
2. Shared calendar behavior: Verify same event IDs seen by all users with access
3. Recurring instance IDs: Document exact format of instance IDs
4. Conflicting timezone specifications: What if `dateTime` has offset AND `timeZone` field differs?
5. All-day event date format: Exact representation when queried
6. Modified recurring instances: Can instance timezone differ from parent?
