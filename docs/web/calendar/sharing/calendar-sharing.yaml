notes: |
  CRITICAL for multi-user scenarios:

  Calendar sharing (two methods):
  1. Share entire calendar via ACL with access levels
  2. Invite users to individual events (creates copy on attendee calendar)

  Access roles (increasing privilege):
  - none: no access
  - freeBusyReader: see busy/free only
  - reader: read events
  - writer: read/write events + see ACLs
  - owner: all writer permissions + modify ACLs

  Event visibility (for shared calendars):
  - default: determined by calendar ACL (can differ per attendee)
  - public: visible to anyone with freeBusyReader+ access
  - private: only visible to writer+ access

  IMPORTANT: Sharing calendar doesn't auto-insert to CalendarList.
  Must explicitly call calendarList.insert for user to see it.

  Primary calendar: user always has owner role, cannot be removed.
