  CRITICAL REFERENCE: Complete Event resource representation.

  Key findings for data model:
  - Event has "id" field (string) - uniqueness scope TBD
  - Event has "iCalUID" field - for iCalendar compatibility
  - Event has "recurringEventId" - links instances to recurring event
  - Times use "date" (all-day) OR "dateTime" (timed) with optional "timeZone"
  - Attendees array contains email, responseStatus, organizer flag
  - "creator" vs "organizer" distinction important for shared calendars
