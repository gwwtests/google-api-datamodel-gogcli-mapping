  FUNDAMENTAL CONCEPTS DOCUMENT - Read first!

  Key distinctions:
  1. Calendar ID = email address format
  2. Primary calendar: user's main calendar, ID = user email, cannot be deleted
  3. Other calendars: have single data owner, can be deleted/transferred
  4. Timed events: use dateTime fields with timezone
  5. All-day events: use date fields (timezone has NO significance)
  6. Calendars collection: global metadata (title, timezone)
  7. CalendarList collection: user-specific properties (color, reminders)

  CRITICAL: Same calendar appears in multiple users' CalendarLists with different properties.
