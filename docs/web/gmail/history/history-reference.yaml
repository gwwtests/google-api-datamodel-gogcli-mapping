  Critical findings for data model:

  1. HISTORY ID:
     - Opaque identifier for mailbox state
     - Used to track changes since last sync
     - Monotonically increasing (newer changes have higher IDs)
     - Required for incremental sync operations

  2. HISTORY RECORDS:
     - Track message/thread/label changes
     - Include added/deleted messages
     - Include label modifications
     - Limited retention period

  3. SYNC MECHANISM:
     - Pass last known historyId to get changes
     - Returns all changes since that point
     - Must handle history expiration
