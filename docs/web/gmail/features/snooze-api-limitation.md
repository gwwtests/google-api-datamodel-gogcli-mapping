# Gmail API Snooze Feature Request - Issue #109952618

**Source**: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/109952618
**Retrieved**: 2026-01-30
**Status**: Blocked

## Overview

This is a feature request asking Google to expose Gmail's native snooze functionality through the Gmail API.

## Request Summary

The requester argues that since snooze is now a core Gmail feature, it should be available via API. They note: "Every 3rd party client under the sun now implements a proprietary snooze feature, which is incompatible with the Gmail feature."

## Key Points

* **Problem**: Third-party clients implement their own snooze systems rather than using Gmail's native functionality
* **Rationale**: Exposing snooze through the API would allow automations to leverage Gmail's native snooze instead of duplicating it
* **Benefit**: Consistent snooze behavior across web app and all third-party clients
